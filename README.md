A joystick/joypad to WASD keyboard event transformer

# usage

Compiling: 

./build-test.sh 

Calling: 

./joystick_wasd

The joystick will dump a view random "sddddd", which you can stop by turning the left stick. After that the joypad will insert the characters needed to control a Tank in the World Of Tanks game by Wargaming.com for example. Still no commandline parameters, you have to change the source if you want to change the keysettings.
